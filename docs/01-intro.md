# Course overview

In this course you will learn to create and evaluate a measurement tool using predominantly quantitative methods, with additional qualitative techniques. You will generate items to create a tool that measures a psychological construct and is informed by existing literature, and then administer this tool and evaluate aspects of its reliability, validity and applicability.

One of the most important aspects of this course is the **process** of measure development. The aim is to think deeply about the phenomenon you are interested in measuring and the experience of your respondents.

We will start with a focus on history and the why and how Psychometrics began. Modern psychometrics may have been created with seemingly altruistic purposes, but it is fundamentally tied to many deeply problematic and ongoing injustices in the world.

As statistical theory and data analysis techniques have evolved we have many more data-driven and complex techniques for analysing psychometric data. This course takes a foundational approach to introduce you to measurement and administration principles, measurement error, reliability and validity. We will focus principally on **Classical Test Theory** as it is a useful way to introduce these concepts. More advanced psychometrics materials will jump straight into complex principles like factor analysis and item response theory, but if your foundations are not strong and your items/questions are rubbish... it doesn't really matter what analyses you do later on!
