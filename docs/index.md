# Overview of this book {-}

This series of chapters and exercises is intended as a companion to the Psychometrics (PSYCH3026/4088) course at the University of Glasgow.

By the end of this course you will be able to
* Understand the principles of Classical Test Theory, reliability and validity.
* Design and generate a measurement tool.
* Critically evaluate the relevance, applicability and psychometric properties of a measurement.
* Compose and write a test manual to an appropriate level.

## How to use this book
For some chapters of this book there will be either a mini-lecture video or links to external resources or videos. For chapters with practical R exercises you will find a walkthrough video that you may use for a reference, but try to do the code yourself first.

You will find both the code and the solutions for the practical R exercises. This is so you can focus on understanding the process and the interpretation of the output rather than getting hung up on the code. As this book develops, simulated data sets will be provided to allow you to practice the same exercises with different data and then test your skills by checking your answers against the solutions

You can copy and paste from the book, however, we strongly encourage you to type out the code by yourself. This will seem much slower and you will make errors, but you will learn much more quickly this way.

Finally, on occasion we will make updates to the book such as fixing typos and including additional detail or activities and as such this book should be considered a living document. When substantial changes are made, new walkthrough videos will be recorded, however, it would be impossible to record a new video every time we made a minor change, therefore, sometimes there may be slight differences between the walkthrough videos and the content of this book. Where there are differences between the book and the video, the book should always be considered the definitive version.
